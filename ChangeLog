	* src/libnetblock.h.in: SWIG compatibility.
	* src/lnb_banning.c (__lnb_check_prog_ban): stopping the checking as
	  soon as a match if found, preserving errno.

	  and made it public. Using a constant for the separator char between
	  different paths. Added more forbidden programs.
	* doc/libnetblock.texi.in: a new chapter about the development library
	  and using libnetblock with SWIG, marked the URLs.

	* libnetblock version 0.2
	  Added a file for pkg-config with library information. Verified that
	  no symbol whose name can't be randomized can be reached from the
	  outside.
	* configure.ac: added new C compiler flags to check for:
	  -Wwrite-strings and -Waggregate-return. Added generating a file
	  for pkg-config.
	* libnetblock.pc.in: a data file for pkg-config.
	* libnetblock.spec.in: added the pkg-config file to the -devel package
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in: added the
	  --enable-public-interface configure option.
	* src/{libnetblock.h.in,lnb_public.c.in}: added version information
	  to the library's public interface.

	* libnetblock version 0.1
	  Initial version. Intercepting: socket, sendmsg+recvmsg,
	  execve (thus the whole exec* family) with the system function (can
	  be used to launch bad programs), bind, a bunch of file opening
	  functions (fopen, fopen64, open, open64, freopen, freopen64,
	  openat, openat64) which can be used to access files under /dev/net,
	  some of the function from the libpcap library, to prevent raw
	  opening of network devices. Implemented program banning. Providing
	  a public interface to use by programmers to secure their programs.
