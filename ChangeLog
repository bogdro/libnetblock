	  fixing warnings found by 'cppcheck'.
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_get_target_link_path): Use realpath() or
	  canonicalize_file_name() if available. Port fixes from LibHideIP:
	  free memory when needed, avoid infinite loops, fixed buffer length

	  LNB_MEMSET() instead of a loop, fixed zero-terminating the buffer.
	* src/lnb_priv.h: Stopped redefining ssize_t - the new, dedicated
	  macros do it for us.
	* src/lnb_cfg.h.in: Added constants for the canonicalize_file_name()
	  and realpath() functions and the rpc.h headers. Updated the package
	  names. Added a flag for HAVE_EXECVEAT, now present in glibc.

	  is not a banned program name (for e.g. symlinks uname->coreutils).
	* src/lnb_exec.c (execveat): Check also if the path is empty and
	  AT_EMPTY_PATH is given - in that case it's the directory descriptor
	  that will be executed, so check that for banning.

	  under non-ANSI-C. Checked running LibNetBlock under GCC address &
	  undefined behaviour sanitizers. Improvements in unit tests.
	* configure.ac: added checking for the stat(), stat64(), lstat64() and
	  getaddrinfo_a functions. Added checking for the -Wstringop-truncation

	* src/lnb_exec.c, src/lnb_net.c: added defining the constants
	  (_DEFAULT_SOURCE) for better compatibility with new C libraries
	* src/lnb_main.c (__lnb_main): when the fopen() functions can't be
	  found by versioned lookup, try normal lookup. This should fix

	  can be passed as a literal.
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_program): change variables'
	  types to more correct ones (size_t), matching their usage. Fix
	  separating the program's name from its arguments.

	  the required macros are properly defined on the target systems) and
	  removed some rpmlint warnings and errors
	* test/*.c, test/Makefile.am: split the unit tests into separate
	  files, one for each functionality/compilation unit with intercepted
	  functions. Added defining the constants (_DEFAULT_SOURCE) for
	  better compatibility with new C libraries

	  types to more correct ones
	* test/lnbtest_exec.c (test_system): call "/bin/cat" instead of just
	  "cat", because that doesn't work on some systems (probably those
	  where /bin/cat is a symlink to 'coreutils')
	* test/lnbtest_banning.c: a new unit test for testing banning

2017-04-23	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /at- users . sourceforge . net>

	* LibNetBlock version 1.0
	  Fixes and improvements to code related with banning the library from
	  interfering with fragile programs. Many code improvements and
	  simplifications in readability and maintenance. More unit tests.
	  Small performance improvements.
	* configure.ac: fixed typos, updated version, checking for the symlink
	  function for unit tests.
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in: added a note that compiling
	  with a C++ compiler won't work right now due to some variable
	  casting constructs that are forbidden in C++. Added a note saying
	  that glibc 2.11 (and potentially other versions) has a bug which may
	  cause LibNetBlock to hang during initialization in dl(v)sym.
	* src/lnb_priv.h: added LNB_SET_ERRNO and LNB_GET_ERRNO macros to
	  simplify code in many places. Added LNB_MAKE_ERRNO_VAR for declaring
	  and initializing a variable that holds the temporary errno value.
	  Renamed SET_ERRNO_PERM to LNB_SET_ERRNO_PERM and SET_ERRNO_MISSING
	  to LNB_SET_ERRNO_MISSING. Added a warning when glibc 2.11 is used.
	* src/*.c: simplified errno usage - not setting where not checked
	  after or when not in a user-called function. Use macros to set and
	  get errno where required. All public functions should now either
	  preserve errno or keep the value set by the original functions.
	* src/lnb_opens.c, src/lnb_pcap.c: surrounded external definitions
	  with >extern "C"<.
	* src/banning-generic.c: a generic file with functions related to
	  banning programs and files from being interfered with by the library.
	  Improved code deduplication and maintenance. The file will be used
	  in LibSecRm, LibHideIP and LibNetBlock.
	* src/lnb_banning.c: include and use banning-generic.c.
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_append_path, __lnb_is_forbidden_program):

	  malloc() is missing.
	* test/lnbtest.c: fixed LSR_ANSIC to LNB_ANSIC (shouldn't be used
	  anyway).
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_socket_unix, test_socket_local,
	  test_socket_banned_netlink, test_socket_banned_raw,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_netlink, test_socket_banned_inet,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_inet): tests renamed to better match what
	  they test.
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_socket_banned_raw6,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_netlink6, test_socket_banned_inet6,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_inet6): added tests related to IPv6.
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_freopen_stdout, test_freopen_stdout_banned,
	  test_freopen_link_banned_stdout): added tests related to freopen().
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_freopen_banned, test_freopen_link_banned):
	  fixed descriptor leak (only in the test itself).

2015-09-06	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /at- users . sourceforge . net>

	* LibNetBlock version 0.6
	  Library marked as not requiring executable stack (security reasons).
	  Fixed runtime dependencies. Fixed banning functions. Fixed errno
	  setting. Minor code cleanup. Added unit tests.
	* configure.ac: checking for the -Wl,-z -Wl,noexecstack compiler
	  option and -z noexecstack linker option. Rearranging the check for
	  libdl to enable the default behaviour (adding it to the LIBS) - this
	  allows using tests and removes the need to preload libdl along with
	  LibNetBlock. Checking for the "check" library for unit tests.
	  Checking for libpcap which should also be present at runtime. Added
	  checking for arpa/inet.h and sys/un.h, if tests are enabled.

	  forbidden
	* test: added unit tests for LibNetBlock
	* src/lnb_opens.c (freopen, freopen64): disallowing also to reopen
	  the standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) to the banned files

	  files in users' home directories). Using AS_HELP_STRING to format
	  help for options. Not checking for memcpy(), lstat() & snprintf().
	* src/lnb_priv.h: added missing LNB_ prefixes
