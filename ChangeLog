	* LibNetBlock version 1.3
	  Added intercepting new functions. Fixed initialization code - fixed
	  lookup for fopen(). Improvements in unit tests. Improvements in code
	  portability and compatibility. Better code maintainability, updated
	  copyright and documentation.
	* configure.ac: moved AC_LANG(C) before AC_PROG_LIBTOOL for improved
	  compatibility. Added checking for the -Wno-nonnull-compare compiler
	  flag to avoid warnings about defensive programming code. Added
	  checking for execveat(), fexecve(), strdup() and snprintf(). Added
	  checking for the -Wchkp, -Wformat-overflow=2, -Wduplicated-cond,
	  -Wrestrict and -Woverlength-strings compiler warning options.
	* missing: script updated from new autoconf
	* src/*.c: defined LNB_VOID to be void in ANSI C void and use that in
	  function definitions for better readability
	* src/lnb_opens.c: simplified the missing functions' declarations
	* src/lnb_exec.c, src/lnb_net.c: added defining the constants
	  (_DEFAULT_SOURCE) for better compatibility with new C libraries
	* src/lnb_main.c (__lnb_main): when the fopen() functions can't be
	  found by versioned lookup, try normal lookup. This should fix
	  compatibility with newer systems and make banning work there
	* doc/libnetblock.texi.in, doc/libnetblock.3: added new URLs, updated
	  the description
	* README, INSTALL: updated the description
	* src/lnb_main.c, src/lnb_priv.h: added substitutes for strdup(),
	  memset() and memcpy()
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_get_target_link_path): rewrite the function
	  usage to correctly drop the "const" qualifier. Add support for
	  symlink targets with paths not absolute, but relative to the symlink.
	  Free the allocated memory on each iteration when it would become
	  unused and lost. Start with duplicating the parameter so that it
	  can be passed as a literal.
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_program): change variables'
	  types to more correct ones (size_t), matching their usage. Fix
	  separating the program's name from its arguments.
	* src/lnb_opens.c: created generic 32-/64-bit functions with common
	  code to be called from the intercepted functions
	* src/lnb_opens.c (generic_freopen): closing the original stream even
	  if opening the new one is forbidden - prevents resource leaks
	* src/lnb_opens.c (open, open64, openat, openat64): move the logger
	  after parameter initialization to display it properly in code based
	  on old-style varargs
	* src/lnb_main.c, src/lnb_priv.h, src/lnb_exec.c,
	  test/lnbtest_exec.c: added intercepting execveat() and fexecve()
	* libnetblock.spec.in: made the spec file more portable (assuming that
	  the required macros are properly defined on the target systems) and
	  removed some rpmlint warnings and errors
	* test/*.c, test/Makefile.am: split the unit tests into separate
	  files, one for each functionality/compilation unit with intercepted
	  functions. Added defining the constants (_DEFAULT_SOURCE) for
	  better compatibility with new C libraries
	* test/lnbtest_exec.c (test_execve_banned): don't pass NULL as the
	  program's environment - pass an array with one NULL instead
	* test/lnbtest_exec.c: fix testing if the banned program wasn't
	  indeed run
	* test/lnbtest_exec.c: remove unused variables
	* test/lnbtest_net.c (test_recvmsg, test_sendmsg): change variables'
	  types to more correct ones
	* test/lnbtest_exec.c (test_system): call "/bin/cat" instead of just
	  "cat", because that doesn't work on some systems (probably those
	  where /bin/cat is a symlink to 'coreutils')
	* test/lnbtest_banning.c: a new unit test for testing banning

2017-04-23	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* LibNetBlock version 1.0
	  Fixes and improvements to code related with banning the library from
	  interfering with fragile programs. Many code improvements and
	  simplifications in readability and maintenance. More unit tests.
	  Small performance improvements.
	* configure.ac: fixed typos, updated version, checking for the symlink
	  function for unit tests.
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in: added a note that compiling
	  with a C++ compiler won't work right now due to some variable
	  casting constructs that are forbidden in C++. Added a note saying
	  that glibc 2.11 (and potentially other versions) has a bug which may
	  cause LibNetBlock to hang during initialization in dl(v)sym.
	* src/lnb_priv.h: added LNB_SET_ERRNO and LNB_GET_ERRNO macros to
	  simplify code in many places. Added LNB_MAKE_ERRNO_VAR for declaring
	  and initializing a variable that holds the temporary errno value.
	  Renamed SET_ERRNO_PERM to LNB_SET_ERRNO_PERM and SET_ERRNO_MISSING
	  to LNB_SET_ERRNO_MISSING. Added a warning when glibc 2.11 is used.
	* src/*.c: simplified errno usage - not setting where not checked
	  after or when not in a user-called function. Use macros to set and
	  get errno where required. All public functions should now either
	  preserve errno or keep the value set by the original functions.
	* src/lnb_opens.c, src/lnb_pcap.c: surrounded external definitions
	  with >extern "C"<.
	* src/banning-generic.c: a generic file with functions related to
	  banning programs and files from being interfered with by the library.
	  Improved code deduplication and maintenance. The file will be used
	  in LibSecRm, LibHideIP and LibNetBlock.
	* src/lnb_banning.c: include and use banning-generic.c.
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_append_path, __lnb_is_forbidden_program):
	  fixed potential buffer overflows
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_append_path): calculate string lengths once
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_program): fixed potential use of
	  uninitialized values
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_get_target_link_path): fix syntax error when
	  malloc() is missing.
	* test/lnbtest.c: fixed LSR_ANSIC to LNB_ANSIC (shouldn't be used
	  anyway).
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_socket_unix, test_socket_local,
	  test_socket_banned_netlink, test_socket_banned_raw,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_netlink, test_socket_banned_inet,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_inet): tests renamed to better match what
	  they test.
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_socket_banned_raw6,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_netlink6, test_socket_banned_inet6,
	  test_socket_banned_proto_inet6): added tests related to IPv6.
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_freopen_stdout, test_freopen_stdout_banned,
	  test_freopen_link_banned_stdout): added tests related to freopen().
	* test/lnbtest.c (test_freopen_banned, test_freopen_link_banned):
	  fixed descriptor leak (only in the test itself).

2015-09-06	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* LibNetBlock version 0.6
	  Library marked as not requiring executable stack (security reasons).
	  Fixed runtime dependencies. Fixed banning functions. Fixed errno
	  setting. Minor code cleanup. Added unit tests.
	* configure.ac: checking for the -Wl,-z -Wl,noexecstack compiler
	  option and -z noexecstack linker option. Rearranging the check for
	  libdl to enable the default behaviour (adding it to the LIBS) - this
	  allows using tests and removes the need to preload libdl along with
	  LibNetBlock. Checking for the "check" library for unit tests.
	  Checking for libpcap which should also be present at runtime. Added
	  checking for arpa/inet.h and sys/un.h, if tests are enabled.
	* libnetblock.spec.in: changed the LibNetBlock URL address to
	  SourceForge and updated filename for the new version
	* doc/libnetblock.3: added SourceForge addresses
	* src/Makefile.am: added the "randomnames" target for easy internal
	  name randomization (hiding LibNetBlock from simple symbol listing),
	  updated library version number
	* src/randomize_names_perl.sh: optimized the name matching
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in: described in detail how to
	  hide LibNetBlock by randomizing internal names
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_file): fixed link checking
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_program): fixed endless loop,
	  fixed link reading
	* src/lnb_banning.c: created new constants for common #defines
	* src/lnb_priv.h: added SET_ERRNO_MISSING to set the errno
	  when the original function is missing on the system. Fixed the
	  value. Added SET_ERRNO_PERM to set the errno when the operation is
	  forbidden
	* test: added unit tests for LibNetBlock
	* src/lnb_opens.c (freopen, freopen64): disallowing also to reopen
	  the standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) to the banned files

2013-06-02	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* LibNetBlock version 0.5

	  requiring malloc().
	* src/libnetblock.h.in: correctly indented constants introduced in 0.4
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in: changed "rpm" to "RPM",
	  commands in separate paragraphs
	* src/lnb_banning.c: added the stdlib.h file, required by getenv().
	  Added the malloc.h file (optional).
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_file,__lnb_is_forbidden_program):
	  small improvements
	* src/lnb_exec.c (__lnb_is_forbidden_program): fixed compiling
	  without malloc(), sys/stat.h, readlink() and getenv().
	* src/Makefile.am: made libnetblock.h not distributed
	* src/lnb_opens.c: removed including the unnecessary malloc.h file

	  Banning mechanism fixed and updated with new possibilities.
	* doc/libnetblock.texi.in: added @dircategory and @direntry.
	* configure.ac: added a summary of enabled options. Added two new
	  command-line banning-related options: --enable-environment
	  (enables additional banning files pointed to by environment
	  variables) and --enable-user-files (enables additional banning
	  files in users' home directories). Using AS_HELP_STRING to format
	  help for options. Not checking for memcpy(), lstat() & snprintf().
	* src/lnb_priv.h: added missing LNB_ prefixes
	* src/lnb_banning.c: support for banning files pointed to by
	  environment variables and additional banning files in users' home
	  directories. Fixed checking if a program is banned.

	  environment variable poiting to an additional banning file location
	  and additional banning files in users' home directories.
	* src/Makefile.am: made libnetblock.h not only in PUBLIC_INTERFACE,
	  since now it is used in lnb_banning.c.
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in, doc/libnetblock.3: updated
	  with new banning information. Minor corrections.

2012-02-11	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libnetblock version 0.3
	  Made the header file SWIG-enabled, updated copyright, code cleanup,
	  efficiency corrected, more forbidden programs, documentation update.
	* libnetblock.spec.in: corrected the description of the devel package.
	* src/libnetblock.h.in: SWIG compatibility.

	  and made it public. Using a constant for the separator char between
	  different paths. Added more forbidden programs.
	* doc/libnetblock.texi.in: a new chapter about the development library
	  and using libnetblock with SWIG, marked the URLs.
	* src/lnb_net.c (socket, bind): allow Unix domain sockets.
	* README, INSTALL: added information about SWIG, fixed typos
	* doc/Makefile.am: fix typo

2011-10-07	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libnetblock version 0.2
	  Added a file for pkg-config with library information. Verified that
	  no symbol whose name can't be randomized can be reached from the
	  outside.
	* configure.ac: added new C compiler flags to check for:
	  -Wwrite-strings and -Waggregate-return. Added generating a file
	  for pkg-config.
	* libnetblock.pc.in: a data file for pkg-config.
	* libnetblock.spec.in: added the pkg-config file to the -devel package
	* README, INSTALL, doc/libnetblock.texi.in: added the
	  --enable-public-interface configure option.
	* src/{libnetblock.h.in,lnb_public.c.in}: added version information
	  to the library's public interface.
	* src/lnb_main.c: removed unused declaration of __lnb_end().
	* Makefile.am: added the file for pkg-config.

2011-06-16	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* libnetblock version 0.1
	  Initial version. Intercepting: socket, sendmsg+recvmsg,
	  execve (thus the whole exec* family) with the system function (can
	  be used to launch bad programs), bind, a bunch of file opening
	  functions (fopen, fopen64, open, open64, freopen, freopen64,
	  openat, openat64) which can be used to access files under /dev/net,
	  some of the function from the libpcap library, to prevent raw
	  opening of network devices. Implemented program banning. Providing
	  a public interface to use by programmers to secure their programs.
