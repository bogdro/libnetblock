	* libnetblock version 0.1
	  Initial version. Intercepting: socket, sendmsg+recvmsg,
	  execve (thus the whole exec* family) with the system function (can
	  be used to launch bad programs), bind, a bunch of file opening
	  functions (fopen, fopen64, open, open64, freopen, freopen64,
	  openat, openat64) which can be used to access files under /dev/net,
	  some of the function from the libpcap library, to prevent raw
	  opening of network devices. Implemented program banning. Providing
	  a public interface to use by programmers to secure their programs.
