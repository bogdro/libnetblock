================================================================

Requirements for compiling:

- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.

- a working C compiler

- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)

  The sys/stat.h contains functions needed to check an executable's type.
  If it is a symbolic link, LibNetBlock will follow it.

  The dlfcn.h header contains functions needed to call the original functions.
  It has to have RTLD_NEXT defined. LibNetBlock wouldn't work without this, so
  it won't compile without this.

- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)

- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the library for your system.

Type 'make' to compile the library.

Documentation comes complied (and can be copied right away), but can be
  changed and recompiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program
  ('texinfo' package).

Type 'make install' to install the library.

Type 'info libnetblock' (after installation) or 'info doc/libnetblock.info'
(before installation) to get help on installing and loading the library.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package (the old way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS

Building an RPM package (the new way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
4) get the rpms from $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386 and $HOME/rpmbuild/SRPMS
