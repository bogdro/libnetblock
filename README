This is the README file for LibNetBlock - a library which blocks
programs from accessing the network.

================================================================

Requirements for compiling:

- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.

- a working C compiler (C++ compilers won't work due to variable casts)

- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)

  Note that some glibc versions (2.11 is known of this) have a bug in their
  dl(v)sym implementation, which may cause LibNetBlock to hang during searching
  for the original versions of the substituted C functions. If you observe
  this, it is best to upgrade glibc. If not possible, you can start deleting
  substituted functions from open() and check each time it your current
  version started to work (yes, this decreases security).

  The sys/stat.h contains functions needed to check an executable's type.
  If it is a symbolic link, LibNetBlock will follow it.

  The dlfcn.h header contains functions needed to call the original functions.
  It has to have RTLD_NEXT defined. LibNetBlock wouldn't work without this, so
  it won't compile without this.

- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)

- the 'make' program

Type

	./configure

to configure the library for your system.

If you want to enable the public interface of LibNetBlock, configure the
 library with

        ./configure --enable-public-interface

 The public interface is compatible with SWIG (http://www.swig.org), so
 you can make native bindings to LibNetBlock for any supported language.

LibNetBlock allows some programs to be banned (not allowed to run under
 LibNetBlock, because they might need accesss to the network). One banning
 file is always supported - ${sysconfdir}/libnetblock.progban (${sysconfdir} is
 /usr/local/etc unless set otherwise during configure).

If you want to disable additional banning files pointed to by environment
 variables, configure the library with

	./configure --enable-environment=no

If you want to disable additional banning files in users' home directories,
 configure the library with

	./configure --enable-user-files=no

Type

	make

to compile the library.

Documentation comes complied (and can be copied right away), but can be
  changed and recompiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program
  ('texinfo' package).

Type

	make install

to install the library.

To make LibNetBlock impossible to detect, you must change all the internal
 public function names. To do this, you can use the name randomizing scripts
 in the src directory. You will need the 'sed' and 'sort' programs and either
 Perl or GNU awk.
You can change the name prefix at the top of these scripts to something
 unique. When the script is done working, reconfigure, recompile and reinstall
 the library.
Thus, a typical build sequence with less detection would be

        ./configure
        cd src
        ./randomize_names_gawk.sh (or 'make randomnames')
        cd ..
        make

NOTE: 'make install' is NOT recommended. Create and install an RPM package
 instead, if possible.

Type 'info libnetblock' (after installation) or 'info doc/libnetblock.info'
(before installation) to get help on installing and loading the library.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package (the old way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
4) get the RPMs from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/ and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS

Building an RPM package (the new way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
4) get the RPMs from $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/ and $HOME/rpmbuild/SRPMS
