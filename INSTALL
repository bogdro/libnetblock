LibNetBlock - a library which blocks programs from accessing the network.

Requirements for compiling the full version:
- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.
- a working C compiler
- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
  with the sys/stat.h and dlfcn.h
- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)
- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the library for your system.
If you want to enable the public interface of LibHideIP, configure the
 library with
        ./configure --enable-public-interface

Type 'make' to compile the library.

Documentation will be compiled (and can be copied right away), if you have
  the 'makeinfo' program ('texinfo' package).

Type 'make install' to install the library.

Building an RPM package (the old way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
