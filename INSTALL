LibNetBlock - a library which blocks programs from accessing the network.

Requirements for compiling the full version:
- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.
- a working C compiler
- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
  with the sys/stat.h and dlfcn.h header files
- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)
- the 'make' program

Type

	./configure

to configure the library for your system.

If you want to enable the public interface of LibNetBlock, configure the
 library with

        ./configure --enable-public-interface

 The public interface is compatible with SWIG (http://www.swig.org), so
 you can make native bindings to LibNetBlock for any supported language.

LibNetBlock allows some programs to be banned (not allowed to run under
 LibNetBlock, because they might need accesss to the network). One banning
 file is always supported - ${sysconfdir}/libnetblock.progban (${sysconfdir} is
 /usr/local/etc unless set otherwise during configure).

If you want to disable additional banning files pointed to by environment
 variables, configure the library with

	./configure --enable-environment=no

If you want to disable additional banning files in users' home directories,
 configure the library with

	./configure --enable-user-files=no

Type

	make

to compile the library.

Documentation will be compiled (and can be copied right away), if you have
  the 'makeinfo' program ('texinfo' package).

Type

	make install

to install the library.

To make LibNetBlock impossible to detect, you must change all the internal
 public function names. To do this, you can use the name randomizing scripts
 in the src directory. You will need the 'sed' and 'sort' programs and either
 Perl or GNU awk.
You can change the name prefix at the top of these scripts to something
 unique. When the script is done working, reconfigure, recompile and reinstall
 the library.
Thus, a typical build sequence with less detection would be

        ./configure
        cd src
        ./randomize_names_gawk.sh (or 'make randomnames')
        cd ..
        make

NOTE: 'make install' is NOT recommended. Create and install an RPM package
 instead, if possible.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package (the old way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
4) get the RPMs from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS

Building an RPM package (the new way):

1) copy the libnetblock.spec file to $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
2) copy the source package libnetblock-XX.tar.gz to $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/libnetblock.spec
